This is a simple script for tagging FLAC files with information supplied from
discogs.com

The script was forked from this one https://code.google.com/p/jwsandbox/ so the
licence is strict GPLv2

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
usage:

you have a dir(we'll name it "newmusic") with music you want to tag. and a
folder in which you usually store music(it's name will be "musicroot")

run

py_tag.py -d musicroot/ -a -i newmusic RELEASE_ID

to tag your files. What it will do for you:

  -d --- specifies the directory where to put music after tagging
  -a --- fetch artist images
  -i --- fetch release images
  RELEASE_ID --- the unique number for each music release on Discogs.com

in order to run the script you *must* have an API key from Discogs. In order to
get it, register on Discogs.com, log in, go to
https://www.discogs.com/users/api_key . Put your API key into ~/.discogs-flactag

~/.discogs-flactag config file format:
[discogs]
API_KEY: your_API_key

discogs.py file is for dealing w/ Discogs API
py_tag.py is for renaming, moving, downloading images, etc

I hope someone finds this one usefull and considers improving it, because I'm
weak @ Python
